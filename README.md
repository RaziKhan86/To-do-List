<h1>HTML for Structure –</h1> The game grid and buttons are created using simple HTML elements like <button> inside a <div> container.

<h1>CSS for Styling – </h1>The layout, colors, and positioning are managed using CSS to make the game visually appealing, including hover effects and animations.

<h1>JavaScript for Game Logic – </h1>JavaScript handles player turns, checks for a win or draw, updates the UI dynamically, and resets the game when needed.

<h1>Event Listeners for Interactivity – </h1>addEventListener() is used to detect button clicks and update the grid with "X" or "O".

<h1>Win Detection Algorithm – </h1>JavaScript checks predefined winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals) to determine if a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
